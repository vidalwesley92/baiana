These wireframes serve as a visual guide, outlining the layout, structure, and functionality of each page or screen within the website. By using Figma, a collaborative design tool, designers and developers can work together seamlessly to iterate on the design, make revisions, and ensure that the final product meets the desired objectives and user needs.
